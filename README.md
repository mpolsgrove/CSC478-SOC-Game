          1. ```pip install "pyramid==1.9.1"```

          1. ```pserve development.ini```

      * Copy the URL provided by the server into a browser window to begin
    
### Installation issues:
   * This project is incompatible with Python 3. 
   
      * The installation instructions are written for versions of Python 2.7.9 or later (up to but not including 3)
      * Earlier versions of Python are not bundled with pip and will require additional steps to install
      
   * To run this game locally requires a minimum of 2 separate browsers
      * At least one browser having an "incognito mode" or its equivalent 
      * The software uses browser sessions to identify players and consequently each player must be playing from a separate browser. 

### Installation Troubleshooting: 
   * Ensure the correct version of Python is installed (Python 2.7.14)
   
   * Ensure the Python path is enabled. 
      * On Windows, this can be checked by going to: 
         * ``` System Properties -> Advanced System Settings -> Environment Variables -> System Variables -> Path``` 
         * C:\Python27 should be part of that path
