    <h3>On Your Turn</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        There are three actions that can be performed on a playerâ€™s turn. First, the player must roll the dice.
        Rolling the dice determines who gets resources on that turn. After rolling the dice, a player is given to buy a
        settlement or trade resources if they have enough resources. The turn ends when the player selects End Turn.
    </p>
</div>
<div >
    <h3>Rolling the Dice</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        Each player must roll the dice on his or her turn. The dice roll is used to determine which players are awarded
        resources on each turn. Each hexagonal tile on the board is marked with a number. Whenever any player rolls the
        number corresponding with a given tile, any player with a settlement bordering that tile receives one resource,
        based on the resource provided by that tile.
    </p>
    <p>
        NOTE: if a player has multiple settlements bordering the same tile, that player will receive one resource per bordering settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
        Each color tile represents a different resource. The resources are as follows:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li style = "color: #A03D21">Brick</li>
        <li style = "color: #D8D370">Grain</li>
        <li style = "color: #546D2F">Lumber</li>
        <li style = "color: #929299">Ore</li>
        <li style = "color: #9ed153">Wool</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Other tiles provide no resources.
    </p>
    <p>
        To roll the dice, select Roll Dice on the right side of the screen. You will then be shown two unrolled dice.
        Select Roll Dice to roll the dice. The two dice rolls will be displayed. The sum of those dice represents the roll.
    </p>

    <h3>Building Settlements</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The first step to building a settlement is to buy one. Settlements cost 1 brick, 1 wool, 1 grain, and 1 lumber.
        If you have enough resources, a settlement can be purchased by clicking on Buy Settlement.
        Once Buy Settlement has been selected, available locations to place a settlement will blink red.
        Click on one of the locations to place a settlement there. If you decide not to purchase a settlement,
        refreshing the page will exit the settlement placement prompt.
    </p>
</div>
<div >
    <h3>Trading Resources</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        If you have 4 or more of a given resource, it can be traded for 1 of a different resource.
        To trade resources, select Trade Resource. This will give you the option to select which resources to trade for with other resource.
        In the top menu, select which resource you would like to trade. In the bottom menu, select which resource you would like to receive.
        Click on Perform Trade to carry out the trade. If you decide not to trade resources, refreshing the page will exit the trade resources prompt.
    </p>
    <p>
        BE CAREFUL: It is possible to trade 4 of one resource for 1 of the same resource, effectively sacrificing 3 resources.
    </p>

    <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
</div>
<div>
    <p>
        The game ends immediately when any player places his or her tenth settlement. The player who places that settlement is the winner!
